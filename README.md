# AstropixBot

This bot gets from [the NASA apod page](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) the image, 
or in case of a video, the thumbnail, and send it to a certain chat.
That image will contain a caption with the title and the link of the explanation about that image. 
When its a video, also will have the link to the youtube video in order to watch it.

If you want to see this bot in action, you are wellcome to join to the [chanel](https://t.me/AstropixChanel).

## Dependencies

You have to install the python telegram bot library using the following command:

```pip3 install python-telegram-bot```

## Credentials

Obviously you must need a `telegram bot token` which you can get from the BotFather, and also a `chat_id` where the bot will send the information.

The last thing you will need is an `api key`. You can get one easly from this [page](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key).

## Acknowledgments
