# AstropixBot

This bot gets from [the NASA apod page](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) the image, 
or in case of a video, the thumbnail, and send it to a certain chat.
That image will contain a caption with the the link of the explanation abaut that image. 
And when its a video, also will have the link to the youtube video in order to watch it.
## Dependencies

You have to install the python telegram bot library by the command:

```pip3 install python-telegram-bot```

## Credentials

Obviuslly you must need a `telegram bot token` wich you can get from the FatherBot, and also a `chat_id` where the bot will send the information.

The last thing you will need is an `api key`. You can get one easly from this [page](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key)
